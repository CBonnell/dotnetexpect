# DotNetExpect


### What is DotNetExpect?
Inspired by the design of the [Expect library](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expect), DotNetExpect is a .NET library that provides console input/control of console-based Windows applications. Unlike other solutions that can only redirect the standard streams of child processes, DotNetExpect directly accesses the console of applications so that regardless of the mechanism the application uses to write to the console (either by writing to the standard streams or by invoking low-level console output functions), DotNetExpect is able to work with a much wider range of console applications.
